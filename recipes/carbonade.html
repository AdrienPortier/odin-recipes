    <h3> Carbonade flamande is a rich and hearty Belgian stew, known for its deep, savory-sweet flavor profile. 
        Made with tender beef simmered in a dark Belgian beer, the dish incorporates onions, thyme, and bay leaves to create a fragrant base. 
        The beer adds a malty sweetness, balanced by the slight tang of mustard and sometimes brown sugar or vinegar. 
        This combination of flavors creates a stew that's both comforting and complex, often served with crispy fries or rustic bread to soak up the flavorful sauce. </h3>
    <p> The recipe for carbonade flamande is relatively simple but requires slow cooking to achieve the perfect texture and taste. 
        First, beef is browned, then simmered with onions in a generous amount of dark beer, which is the key ingredient. 
        Mustard, herbs, and a touch of sweetness from sugar or vinegar are added for depth. The stew is left to cook slowly, allowing the flavors to meld together and the beef to become tender. 
        After a couple of hours, it’s ready to be served, often accompanied by classic Belgian sides like fries or mashed potatoes. </p>
    <h2> Ingredients needed for 4 portions </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> One and a quarter kg of stewing beef, cut into 4cm cubes</li>
        <li> 400ml of Trappist ale such as Leffe or Chimay, or other dark ale</li>
        <li> 3 garlic cloves, lightly crushed </li>
        <li> 2 bay leaves </li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons of plain flour, seasoned with salt and pepper </li>
        <li> 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil </li>
        <li> 250g of diced pancetta </li>
        <li> 2 carrots, sliced </li>
        <li> 2 onions, sliced </li>
        <li> 1 leek, sliced </li>
        <li> A tablespoon of tomato purée </li>
        <li> 350ml of beek stock </li>
        <li> A bouquet garni (a small bunch of thyme, parsley stalks, a bay leaf and about 6 peppercorns tied in muslin</li>
        <li> A handful of parsley, chopped </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong> Marinate the beef overnight </strong> in the ale with the garlic and bay leaves. 
            The next day, drain the beef from the marinade, reserving the marinade. 
            Pat the meat dry with kitchen paper and toss it in the seasoned flour until evenly coated. 
            Shake off any excess flour. </li>
        <li> Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil in a large flameproof casserole until hot. 
            Fry the beef in 3-4 batches for about 5 minutes per batch, stirring occasionally, until it is a rich golden brown all over. 
            You may need to add a little more oil between batches but make sure it is hot again before adding the next batch. 
            Remove the meat with a slotted spoon to a plate and set aside. Don’t worry if the bottom of the casserole is starting to brown, this all adds to the flavour of the finished dish. </li>
        <li> Lower the heat to medium and fry the pancetta in the casserole for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until crisp and golden. 
            Scoop the pancetta out with a slotted spoon and set aside with the beef.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to fan 140C/conventional 160C/gas 3. Tip the carrots, onions and leek into the casserole and fry, stirring occasionally, until they start to brown – this takes about 12 minutes. 
            Spoon in the tomato purée and continue to cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. </li>
        <li> Add the beef and pour in the reserved marinade. Bring to a simmer, scraping any sticky bits off the bottom of the pan, then add all the beef stock and bouquet garni to the casserole. 
            Season with salt and pepper and bring everything to the boil. Remove from the heat. Cover with a lid and <strong> cook in the oven for 2 hours </strong>, stirring once halfway through. 
            (The carbonnade may now be left to cool and frozen for up to 1 month. Add 100ml/31⁄2 fl oz more stock to the sauce when reheating.) 
            When the beef is ready, <strong> taste for seasoning </strong> and add more salt and pepper if you think it needs it. 
            Scatter the chopped parsley over the top and serve straight from the casserole, with creamy mash or jacket potatoes and buttered greens or cabbage. </li>
    </ol>
