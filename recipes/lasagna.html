    <h3> Lasagna is a famous italian dish with a delicious bolognese sauce between stacked layers of lasagna (here the type of pasta).</h3>
    <p> The principal thing to know about this recipe is that you should put successives layers of bolognese and lasagna, alternating between both, to have a onctuous flavour at the end, mixing the thin sheet of lasagna and the creamy aspect
        of the tomato. </p>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong> Make the bolognese sauce : </strong> <p> For the lasagna recipe, peel and finely chop garlic. Peel and dice the onion and carrots. 
            Heat a little olive oil in a large pan and fry the onions, carrots and garlic. Add the minced beef and brown evenly, using a wooden spoon to break it up as you go. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
            Then add the chopped tomatoes and season again with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over a medium heat for approx. 15–20 min. Stir in the dried oregano. </p> </li>
        <li> <strong> Make the béchamel sauce : </strong> <p> Preheat the oven for the lasagna to 200°C/390°F fan or 220°C/430°F top/bottom heat. For the béchamel sauce, melt the butter in a small saucepan. 
            Add the flour and brown while stirring. 
            Gradually add the cold milk, stirring constantly, then reduce the heat and cook for approx. 5–8 min. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt and pepper. </p></li>
        <li> <strong> Assemble the lasagna : </strong> <p> Cover the base of the casserole dish with olive oil and then with a layer of béchamel. Now layer the lasagna sheets first, then the Bolognese and béchamel sauce in succession. 
            Repeat until all the ingredients have been used up, finishing with béchamel on top.</p></li>
        <li> <strong> The final touch : </strong> <p> Grate the Parmesan over the last layer, transfer the lasagna to the preheated oven on the middle shelf and bake for approx. 
            30–40 min., or until the top is golden. Serve in the hot oven dish. </p></li>
